### Abstract
The security of current digital signature systems is in danger because they are not quantum secure. Hash-based digital signature schemes provide a good countermeasure, but they generally perform worse in comparison to classical schemes. Therefore, performance improvement remains a crucial task. In this work, several state of-the-art hash-based signature systems are analyzed in detail and methods for performance improvement are presented. Using these methods, key generation is 25% faster and signature verification up to 22% faster. However, signature size is increased by up to 29%.
