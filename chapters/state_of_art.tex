In this chapter, state-of-the-art works regarding quantum-secure \textit{hash-based signature systems (HBS)} and their performance improvement are proposed. 
First, the two categories \textit{stateful}- and \textit{stateless} HBS are explained. % Afterwards ...

\section{Stateful HBS} % maybe put part of this stateful explanation in introduction
Most common digital signature systems currently in use are stateless signature systems: The signer has one secret key that is used multiple times for signing. In stateful signature schemes, one secret key is only used once, therefore referred to as one-time key. If the key same key is used more than once, the security will be compromised. 
To achieve this, the signer needs to maintain a state (of the current key) while signing messages (that is updated after every signature).
A stateful scheme is therefore less practical than a stateless scheme, as a careful treatment of its one-time key states is required. 
In some situations, managing states is acceptable for meeting other demands: In comparison with other quantum-secure stateless HBS, stateful HBS are more efficient, the signature is smaller, and there are more signing occasions.~\cite{properties_stateless_HBS_2022}
The most recent stateful HBS are the  Leighton-Micali Signature Scheme (LMS)~\cite{LMS_RFC8554} and the eXtended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS)~\cite{xmss_RFC8391}. They are standardized and recommended for usage as quantum-secure HBS by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)~\cite{stateful_hashbased_sign_schemes_NIST_2020}. Both these signature schemes are explained in detail as a part of this work. For LMS, see Section~\ref{sec:lms}, for XMSS see Section~\ref{sec:xmss}.

\section{Stateless HBS}
% is the typical / common signature system
The most common stateless HBS is SPHINCS+~\cite{tweakable_basispaper_sphincs_2019}. It is recommended and standardized by NIST. 
% SPHINCS / SPHINCS+ [zustandslos/frei] (hypertrees) 
% wird "kÃ¼nstlich" stateless gemacht durch hypertrees -> unwahrscheinlich 2x gleichen one-time key zu bekommen

% multi tree variant XMSS -> stateless?

% ab hier -> versch. implementierungen / versionen von LMS, XMSS, SPHINCS+


% other variants (maybe introduction):
% picnic -> ZKP scheme?
% Rainbow, GeMMs -> MultiVariate
% crystals-dilithium, falcon -> Lattice

% The focus will not be on works regarding solely other classical digital signature systems (e.g. RSA) as these generally outperform hash-based signature systems (performance, signature/key size), but do not fulfill the requirement to be quantum secure~\cite{RSA_pq-attack_examples_2018,comparison_performance_RSA_ECDSA_Merkle_WOTS_2021}.
