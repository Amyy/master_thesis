In this chapter, the motivation and goals of this work are proposed. First, the quantum threat is introduced. Afterwards, 

\section{Quantum Threat}
% maybe: what is a quantum computer / quantum computing here
Quantum computing theory has been researched extensively and is considered the greatest threat to present modern cryptography, also referred to as \textit{quantum threat}~\cite{impact_quantum_crypto_2018}.
The beginning was in 1996, when Shor~\cite{shors_algo_original_1999} proposed a quantum algorithm for factorization that is exponentially faster than any known classical algorithm. In 1996, Grover~\cite{grovers_algo_basispaper_1997} proposed a quantum searching algorithm, speeding up search efficiency from classical $\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\sqrt{N}$. 
Based on these discoveries, further research shows that present asymmetric cryptographic schemes (whose security is based on the difficulty of factorizing large prime numbers and the discrete logarithm problem) can be broken, once a quantum computer with a sufficient number of qbits exists. 
Symmetric cryptography is also effected by this quantum threat, however, its security can be increased by using larger key spaces.~\cite{impact_quantum_crypto_2018} % also basic quantum comp. paper here
Example quantum attacks on RSA (which security relies on the prime factorization problem) are shown by Soni et al.~\cite{RSA_pq-attack_examples_2018} and Wang et al.~\cite{RSA_pq-attack_without_factorization_2018}. % source for RSA basic paper

There exist five main classes of cryptographic systems considered more resistant against quantum attacks, also denoted as \textit{quantum secure}: Hash-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, lattice-based cryptography, multivariate-quadratic-equations cryptography and secret-key cryptography.~\cite{book_pqc_bernstein_2004}
In this work, the focus lies on hash-based cryptography used for digital signature systems, referred to as \textit{hash-based signature systems (HBS)}.

\section{Goals} 
% Comparison RSA/ECDSA with WOTS/MSS:
Quantum secure cryptographic schemes have an overall worse performance in comparison to classical cryptographic systems, % source ?
this is also a problem for hash-based signature systems. The classical algorithms elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) and Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) outperform HBS. Noel et al.~\cite{comparison_performance_RSA_ECDSA_Merkle_WOTS_2021} show that the two classical algorithms ECDSA (elliptic curve digital signature algorithm~\cite{}) and RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman~\cite{}) outperform MSS (common HBS, see Section~\ref{sec:mss}) in key generation time, signature generation and verification time.

Therefore, finding possible improvements for existing HBS to make them more efficient is a crucial for task. % to make using them realistic/reasonable
There exist several ideas/concepts already attempting to make existing hash-based signature more efficient are proposed in Chapter~\ref{cha:stateOfTheArt}.
% Performance improvement of existing HBS is also the goal of this work (before: explaining them in detail in background)

% Reference to Methods/T5 stuff etc. -> (T5) Ziel ist Aufwand von Verfahren zu reduzieren, ohne Sicherheit zu beeinflussen
This is to substitute the standard Merkle Tree with the \tftree and \extree concepts, to speed up LMS, XMSS and potentially other signature schemes based on Merkle Trees.
